# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix

## ❌ Error: ModuleNotFoundError: plotly

## ✅ SOLUTION: Updated Files

I've created the following files to fix the deployment issue:

### 1. **requirements.txt** (Main requirements file)
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.5.0
plotly>=5.15.0
numpy>=1.24.0
openpyxl>=3.1.0
```

### 2. **.streamlit/config.toml** (Streamlit configuration)
```
[server]
headless = true
port = 8501
enableCORS = false
enableXsrfProtection = false

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false

[theme]
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f0f2f6"
textColor = "#262730"
```

### 3. **dashboard.py** (Updated with error handling)
- Added try/catch for plotly imports
- Better error handling for missing dependencies

## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Update Your GitHub Repository
Upload these files to your GitHub repository:
- ✅ `requirements.txt` (NEW - this is the key fix!)
- ✅ `.streamlit/config.toml` (NEW)
- ✅ `dashboard.py` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `support_analysis.xlsx`
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ `.gitignore`

### Step 2: Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. Find your existing app
3. Click "Reboot app" or "Deploy" again
4. Streamlit will now use `requirements.txt` instead of `requirements_dashboard.txt`

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
Your app should now work without the plotly error!

## 🎯 KEY FIXES

1. **requirements.txt**: Streamlit Cloud looks for this specific filename
2. **Error handling**: Dashboard now handles missing imports gracefully
3. **Configuration**: Proper Streamlit config for cloud deployment

## 📋 Files to Upload to GitHub

Make sure these files are in your GitHub repository:
- [ ] requirements.txt ⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT)
- [ ] .streamlit/config.toml
- [ ] dashboard.py
- [ ] support_analysis.xlsx
- [ ] README.md
- [ ] .gitignore

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Test locally first
python test_dependencies.py

# If all tests pass, upload to GitHub and redeploy!
```

The main issue was that Streamlit Cloud looks for `requirements.txt` by default, not `requirements_dashboard.txt`. This fix should resolve the plotly import error!
